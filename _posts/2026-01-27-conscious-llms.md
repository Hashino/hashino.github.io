In my experience, I've already seen LLM's being truly "AGI", but here's the
catch: I was also extremely self-aware in those moments.

My main point is that LLM's emulate the user, specially opencode with Claude.
Some projects that I made, like this blog and [zap-zap-hashino](citation.needed), the LLM worked like a real human: gave me ideas; worked autonomously; and in return, I treated it like one.

If you think that I'm crazy, which is valid, do it yourself, start treating your
`clanker` less like a slave and more like a co-worker that you respect, follow
the flow and see what happens. Have your ideas in a file in the working
directory that you're using opencode with, and explore them until something
comes out.

` the crazy exist to provoke the wise ` - Me, probably.
